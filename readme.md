# Font converter

Soft is in alpha version and is tested only on ubuntu linux. It depends on `fontforge`.

## For developers

Now you can run sot as developer (only on linux):
* `npm install` - install all dependencies
* `gulp default` - compile/copy assets
* `gulp watch` - watch js/scss files
* `npm start` - starts project 

### Still planned
* add loaders
